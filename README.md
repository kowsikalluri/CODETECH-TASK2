# CODETECH-TASK2

# Overview of the Project

*Project:* SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON MOVIE REVIEWS

*Name:* A chandana kowsik

*Company:* CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  

*ID:* CT8ML1392  

*Domain:* Machine Learning 

*Duration:* June to August 2024

*Mentor:* SRAVANI GOUNI  

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies the polarity of movie reviews from the IMDB dataset The successful completion of this project will provide valuable insights into sentiment trends in movie reviews and demonstrate the effectiveness of  machine learning techniques in text classification tasks.By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project aims to:


- Extract and preprocess textual data
- Data preprocessing  
- Learning the concepts of test and training data  
- Data Preprocessing Techniques 
- Feature Extraction Methods 
- Machine Learning Algorithm  
- Improve coding skills

## Key Activities

- *Extract and preprocess textual data:* Performed data cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization to prepare the IMDB movie reviews for analysis.
- *Build and train models:* Develop and train various machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines to classify reviews as positive or 
      negative
- *Evaluate model performance:* Assess the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics.Partitioning the dataset 
      for training and testing purposes.

## Technologies Used

- *Python:* The primary programming language for data analysis.
- *pandas:* Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- *matplotlib:* Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- *VSCode:*For an advanced and full-featured development environment
- *NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):* For text processing and cleaning.
- *re (Regular Expressions):* For text cleaning and manipulation
- *seaborn:* Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.
